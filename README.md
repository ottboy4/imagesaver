# imagesaver
My name is Caleb Ott and this is a project I created at Neumont University as part of the Interactive WebDev course, taught by Tim Clark.

The project was created in Intellij and is a Chrome extension.

This chrome extension's purpose is to help users save images easily while browsing the web. While on any website, if an image is loaded it will have 2 semi-transparent buttons that allow the user to download and save images. The download simply does a quick download, whereas the save stores the image in the chrome extension. Later through the extension, you may view the stored images and download them at that time. Images can be stored in a folder based structure using drag and drop. Folders can also be downloaded as a zipped file.

Since the project was only part of a class, the project was never completed to its most full potential. There are a lot of ideas I wanted to add to it on top of what is already existing.
